I built a full stack Next.js app [Next.js-Blog-App](https://github.com/hiretimsf/Next.js-Blog-App) that has earned more than **460 GitHub stars**. 

The project received official recognition for my open source contribution in the form of Vercel Swag from former CTO **Lee Robinson**. 

This was a significant milestone for me, as it validated the effort I put into creating high-quality, open-source resources for the Next.js community.

## Official Recognition

## Project Impact

The Next.js Blog App was designed to be a robust starting point for developers looking to build modern, SEO-friendly blogs. It features:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for optimal performance.
- **Dynamic Routing** for blog posts and categories.
- **SEO Optimization** built-in.
- **Responsive Design** across all devices.

The community feedback has been incredible, and I'm proud to see so many developers using it as a foundation for their own projects.
