## Project

I built and open sourced a full stack Next.js and Supabase [blog-app](https://github.com/hiretimsf/Next.js-Blog-App) with over 460 GitHub stars. It is a multi user platform with auth, database, storage, and CMS, built with TypeScript and modern Next.js features.

## Recognition

A few weeks later, I received Vercel swag in the mail. It was my first real recognition for open source work, and it motivated me to keep building. I am very grateful.
