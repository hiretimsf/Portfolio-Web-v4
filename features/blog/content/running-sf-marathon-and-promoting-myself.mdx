## Marathon
I ran 26.2 miles at the 2025 San Francisco Marathon. It was hard, slow, and unforgettable. I did not run just to reach the finish line. I ran to tell my story.
</Step>

<Step>
## Main Purpose

I wore a custom shirt with my portfolio website on it. Finding a tech job is tough. Running a marathon is tough too. I decided to mix both.

## Race Day

The course was hilly and foggy. The crowd helped a lot. Seeing my family at the finish made everything worth it.

- **Distance:** 26.2 miles
- **Time:** 5 hours 54 minutes
- **Bib:** 8332

## Looking to 2026

I train every day for the 2026 San Francisco Marathon. My goal is 3 hours 25 minutes. That time would qualify me for the Boston Marathon.
