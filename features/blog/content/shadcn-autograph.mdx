<Steps>

<Step>
## The beginning

It started with a genuine tweet. I reached out [shadcn](https://x.com/shadcn) with a slightly unusual request. I wanted his autograph on my homemade T shirt.

I also received a reply from [Evil Rabbit](https://x.com/evilrabbit), Vercel's Founding Design Engineer.

## Support 

[Shadcn](https://x.com/shadcn) also tweeted "Someone Hire Tim" and I'm very grateful for his support.

## The follow up

Some time later, I followed up on my request by referencing an old Vercel community post of mine.

Thanks to the amazing [Pauline P. Narvas](https://x.com/paw_lean) from the Vercel Community team, shadcn actually replied! He bookmarked the tweet, which gives me high hopes.

Now, I'm preparing my custom handmade t-shirt and packaging it up for shipment. I'll be following up soon, and I'm crossing my fingers for another response.

Wish me luck! I'll keep you all updated on the journey.
