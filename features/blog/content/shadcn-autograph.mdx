import { Tweet } from "react-tweet";

It all started with a genuine tweet. I'm a big fan of **shadcn**, whose work has helped millions of developers (myself included) ship faster and build better interfaces.

I decided to reach out with a slightly unusual request: I wanted his autograph on my homemade t-shirt.

<Tweet id="1930094628885471387" />

Some time later, I followed up on my request by referencing an old Vercel community post of mine. 

<Tweet id="2009307622059491448" />

Thanks to the amazing **@paw_lean** from the Vercel Community team, shadcn actually replied! He bookmarked the tweet, which gives me high hopes.

Now, I'm preparing my custom handmade t-shirt and packaging it up for shipment. I'll be following up soon, and I'm crossing my fingers for another response.

Wish me luck! I'll keep you all updated on the journey.
